# Fuzzing

Coverage-guided (libFuzzer) fuzzing of the two parsers that read attacker-
influenceable ACME server bytes: the JSON parser and the HTTP-response parser.
Both targets are built from the SHIPPED parser source by their `extract_*.sh`
slicers — no hand-maintained copy and no nginx build tree required.
`fuzz/build.sh` builds both (`fuzz_json`, `fuzz_http`).

## Targets

### `fuzz_json`

Exercises the JSON parser over arbitrary byte sequences with ASan and UBSan.
It covers:

- `ngx_autocert_json_parse()` — recursive-descent over arbitrary input
- `ngx_autocert_json_object_get()` / `ngx_autocert_json_object_str()` —
  member lookup and string extraction
- `ngx_autocert_json_array_count()` / `ngx_autocert_json_array_item()` —
  array traversal
- `ngx_autocert_json_number_int()` — integer conversion with overflow guard

### `fuzz_http`

Exercises the ACME HTTP-response parser over arbitrary byte sequences:

- `ngx_autocert_acme_parse_response()` — status line (`HTTP/1.x` + 3-digit
  code), header scan, `Content-Length` / `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` framing
- `ngx_autocert_acme_dechunk()` — chunked-body decode (size arithmetic,
  overflow guard, CRLF framing), reached via `parse_response`

The harness builds a minimal `ngx_autocert_acme_request_t` in the shim and
feeds the whole input as the receive buffer in one shot — the way the read
handler hands accumulated bytes to `parse_response`, which internally
dispatches to `dechunk` for a chunked body, so one call exercises both. A
fully decoded chunked body is read back byte-by-byte so ASAN validates the
freshly allocated output region too. (A clean libFuzzer target over
`parse_response` alone is practical here precisely because these functions take
only the buffer + a handful of plain fields — no live connection — so no
fallback to fuzzing `dechunk` in isolation was needed.)

Why these targets: both parsers read ACME server response bytes
— bytes that arrive over a verified-TLS channel but are still attacker-
influenceable (compromised CA, hostile redirect, buggy server). A single
off-by-one in the string escape decoder, surrogate-pair branch, or
number/literal scanner would be a worker-crashing OOB read. The parser is
written defensively (bounded nesting at 32 levels, length-delimited, no NUL
reliance) but coverage-guided fuzzing catches that bug class more reliably than
the ACME integration tests.

## No copy drift

Neither target contains a copy of its parser. `extract_parser.sh` slices the
JSON parser (types from `ngx_autocert_json.h` + bodies from
`ngx_autocert_json.c`) into `generated_json.inc`, compiled against `ngx_shim.h`.
`extract_http.sh` slices the six self-contained HTTP parser functions
(`url_part_safe`, `parse_url`, `memmem`, `header`, `parse_response`, `dechunk`)
out of `ngx_autocert_acme.c` into `generated_http.inc`, compiled against
`ngx_http_shim.h`. (The rest of `ngx_autocert_acme.c` is the event-driven TLS
client — DNS / connect / handshake — which the parser functions never touch, so
slicing avoids linking the whole nginx event/SSL/resolver tree just to fuzz the
byte crunchers.) If a signature or body changes upstream, the next build picks
it up — or fails loudly rather than fuzz stale code.

`ngx_http_shim.h` mirrors the reduced `ngx_autocert_acme_request_t` surface the
parser reads (pool, url/host/port/uri, recv `ngx_buf_t`, headers array, the
`headers_done` / `chunked` / `content_length` / `body_offset` framing fields)
plus the `ngx_string` / `ngx_array` / `ngx_atoi` / `ngx_atoof` helpers, with
identical semantics. The same shim + slice also back the standalone unit test
`tests/unit/test_http.c`.

`ngx_shim.h` supplies the minimal nginx surface the JSON parser touches:
`ngx_pool_t` with a malloc-backed allocator, `ngx_pcalloc` / `ngx_pnalloc`,
`ngx_strlen` / `ngx_strncmp`, a stub `ngx_log_debug1` macro, and the core
types (`u_char`, `ngx_int_t`, `ngx_uint_t`, `ngx_str_t`, `NGX_OK`,
`NGX_ERROR`, `NGX_DECLINED`).

The harness allocates a buffer sized **exactly** to `size` bytes with **no**
trailing NUL, so ASAN turns any read at or past the end into an immediate
heap-buffer-overflow.

## Build & run locally

```bash
# needs clang with libFuzzer (clang >= 6) — no nginx build tree needed
CC=clang bash fuzz/build.sh          # -> fuzz/fuzz_json + fuzz/fuzz_http
cd fuzz
./fuzz_json -max_total_time=120 -print_final_stats=1 corpus/
./fuzz_http -max_total_time=120 -print_final_stats=1 corpus_http/
```

The valgrind-replay path (plain compile, no sanitizers):

```bash
CC=clang CFLAGS='-g -O1' bash fuzz/build.sh
```

A crash drops a `crash-*` reproducer; re-run with `./fuzz_json crash-<id>` to
reproduce. Add the reproducer to `corpus/` (named `regress_*`) so it becomes a
permanent regression seed.

## Corpus

`corpus/` contains 10 seed inputs covering the main ACME response shapes:

| file | covers |
|---|---|
| `directory.json` | ACME directory object |
| `order.json` | order with identifiers + authorizations arrays |
| `account.json` | newAccount response |
| `authz.json` | authorization + challenges array |
| `escapes.json` | all JSON string escape types incl. surrogate pairs |
| `numbers.json` | integer, negative, float, exponent edge cases |
| `unicode.json` | UTF-8 multibyte strings in array |
| `deep_nest.json` | 9-level object nesting |
| `truncated.json` | mid-string truncation (parse error path) |
| `empty_obj.json` | minimal valid input |

`corpus_http/` seeds the HTTP target with valid, chunked and malformed
responses:

| file | covers |
|---|---|
| `cl_ok` | 200 with a `Content-Length` body |
| `created` | 201 with a `Location` header (account register) |
| `chunked` | `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` multi-chunk body |
| `notfound` | `HTTP/1.0` 404, zero-length body |
| `bad_ver` | non-`HTTP/1.x` version (reject path) |
| `bad_code` | non-numeric status code (reject path) |
| `big_chunk` | oversized chunk-size line (framing arithmetic) |
| `junk` | no CRLF at all (header-incomplete path) |

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci-deep.yml` runs both targets long (14400s each) monthly
(1st of the month) and on manual dispatch, alongside the memcheck/helgrind soaks
and the security scanners. `.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml` runs a 120s/target
regression on every PR/push (with `fuzz.dict`); `valgrind.yml` (60s memcheck
soak) and `security-scanners.yml` gate the same PR/push events. The per-change
build gate is the ASan+UBSan build-test suite in `build-test.yml`.
