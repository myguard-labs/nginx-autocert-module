# Dual-certificate SERVE e2e test — no ACME, no docker, no root.
#
# Proves the Phase B serve path (serve.c cert_cb 2-slot install): with BOTH an
# ECDSA and an RSA cert on disk for one name, the worker installs both on the
# connection and OpenSSL picks the leaf matching the client's offered signature
# algorithms. We drop two self-signed pairs into one store dir:
#   EC : privkey.pem      / fullchain.pem      (slot 0, legacy flat names)
#   RSA: privkey.rsa.pem  / fullchain.rsa.pem  (slot 1)
# then handshake forcing EC-only vs RSA-only sigalgs and assert the served leaf's
# public-key algorithm each time. Also asserts an unconstrained client gets a
# valid leaf, and that with ONLY the RSA pair present the RSA cert still serves
# (single-slot path unaffected).
#
# Inputs (env):
#   SERVER_BIN   - path to the built nginx/angie binary (required)
#   NGX_BUILD_DIR- build dir holding objs/*.so (defaults to dir of SERVER_BIN)
