# Worker-0 ACME driver lifecycle test (P1 worker-0 migration; replaces the old
# helper-lifecycle.sh + helper-usr2.sh, which tested the removed helper process).
#
# The ACME engine runs on worker 0 behind an flock singleton lock
# (<autocert_store_path>/.driver.lock). This asserts:
#   START   exactly one worker arms the driver ("ACME driver armed on worker 0").
#   RELOAD  the lock hands off: the retiring worker 0 releases, a fresh worker 0
#           re-arms — so the armed-pid changes and is alive, and at most one
#           driver is live at a time. Clean error log (no emerg/alert).
#   CRASH   SIGKILL the driver's worker 0; the master respawns a worker that
#           re-arms the driver with a new pid.
#   STOP    master + workers exit cleanly, pidfile removed, no orphan worker.
#
# step 26 mutation coverage (recorded 2026-08-09, memory/labs/nginx-autocert-module/
# mutation-findings-step26.md): the START phase is this suite's baseline case —
# it proves the module is actually loaded and blocking, not merely configured.
# Verified by commenting out `load_module $HTTP_SO;` in the generated config: nginx
# then fails with "[emerg] unknown directive \"autocert\"", never writes the
# pidfile, and `MASTER=$(cat ...) || fail "no master pidfile"` (then
# `wait_armed` / A1) catches it — RC=1, confirmed by an actual run, not reasoning.
#
# Usage: worker0-driver.sh   (env: NGX_BUILD_DIR, optional AC_TEST_PORT)
