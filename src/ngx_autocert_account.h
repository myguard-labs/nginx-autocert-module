/*
 * ngx_autocert_account — ACME account bootstrap on the helper process (M4d-2).
 *
 * Drives the first three steps of the ACME protocol (RFC 8555) using the M4b
 * HTTPS client, the M4c JSON reader and the M3 JOSE/ECDSA crypto, all of which
 * are compiled into the CORE helper module:
 *
 *   1. GET  <directory>            — discover newNonce / newAccount URLs (M4c)
 *   2. GET  <newNonce>             — take the Replay-Nonce response header
 * (M4d-1)
 *   3. POST <newAccount> (JWS)     — register; the account URL ("kid") comes
 * back in the Location response header
 *
 * The account key (ECDSA, curve from autocert_key_type) is loaded from
 * <autocert_path>/account.key if present, else generated and persisted there
 * with 0600 perms. After a successful register, the account holds the key and
 * the kid that every later ACME POST (newOrder, finalize, …) signs with.
 *
 * Single in-flight account bootstrap per helper; the steps chain through the
 * client's completion callbacks on the helper event loop. The caller is
 * notified once via the handler with NGX_OK (acct->kid valid) or NGX_ERROR.
