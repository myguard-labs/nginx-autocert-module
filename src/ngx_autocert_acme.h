 * ngx_autocert_acme — outbound HTTP/1.1-over-TLS client for the ACME helper
 * (M4b).
 *
 * A minimal, single-request-at-a-time HTTPS client that runs entirely on the
 * helper process's nginx event loop: async DNS via ngx_resolver, non-blocking
 * connect via ngx_event_connect_peer, a TLS handshake via ngx_ssl with peer
 * certificate verification, then one HTTP/1.1 request and a buffered response.
 *
 * This is the transport the ACME state machine (M4c+) builds on. M4b proves it
 * by fetching the CA directory document over TLS (Pebble in CI). Only GET is
 * needed for the directory; POST (for newAccount/newOrder, JWS bodies) lands
 * with the ACME flow in later milestones — the request struct already carries a
 * method + body so adding POST is additive.
 *
 * Lifecycle: one ngx_autocert_acme_request_t per in-flight request, allocated
 * from a per-request pool the caller owns. The caller's completion handler is
 * invoked exactly once, on success OR failure; after it returns the request
 * (and its pool) may be destroyed.
